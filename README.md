 StartUp Again is a website bringing entrepreneurs and products/ideas together.
 

**Purpose:** We are creating a two sided marketplace for entrepreneurs of either past or future startups. This web app, called StartUp Again, is to on-sell failed startups, that maybe have a great product, just the business never got off the ground. A lot of money may have been put into the idea, and rather than take the full loss the founder may be able to on-sell their product, gleaning back some of their outlay, while the buyer receives a product they feel has viability.

 

 **Functionality / features:** We have 4 levels of features.

1. Our most basic MVP -

 \- users may login and create a profile

 \- users may create, edit, update and destroy their own listings

 \- logins shall be authenticated

 

2. Everything from step 1 plus -

 \- admin will be able to moderate the web app along with deleting any toxic messages or spam listings

 \- private messaging for users to talk to each other

 

3. Everything from 1 and 2 plus -

 \- users may create a watchlist of products they may be interested in

 \- users can upload and swap NDAs and contracts

 

4. Everything from the first 3 plus -

 \- users may tag their product by category eg financial, fashion, disabilities, tech etc

 \- users may search for startup products/ideas by category

 \- users may bid on products

 

5. This is the ultimate idea. It is all 4 previous points plus -

 \- sort by popularity

 \- being able to list you product as either an auction or buy it now

 \- thread comments on a product

 

**Target audience** – Our target audience fall onto two main groups of people. One are those who have attempted a StartUp and it has not been successful. They may have put a lot of time, resources and energy into the idea and want to recoup their costs, or they just want to see their idea come to fruition and just not have the connections or support they need so want to onsell their idea.


The second group of people are those who would like to start a business and may not have a viable idea to run with. Or those who like to grow businesses and looking for a new challenge. Or those who have seen a product they really like and can see a future for and have the right connections to make it happen. It is a platform for entrepreneurs to grab great products and try to make them their own. And make them a success.
